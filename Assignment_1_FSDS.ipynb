    "# 1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be ?\n",
    "integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",

    "# 2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER-The set of characters is known as string.In python programming language is represented by single quote '' or double quote \"\".Example-> \"hello\" ,'HELLO'.\n",

    " Which store something in it is knowm as variable,or in simple words you can say it like a container.\n",
    " In programming languages,variables are statically typed.IN python we have not to take care of declare and defined a variable in advanced as other programming languages.To create a variable,you just to need assign it a value and use it,the assignment is done by single equals sign =.\n",
    " Example-> n=10 m=\"ineuron\"  and then print it by using print function ,print(n) o/p-> 10.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " # 3. Describe three different data types?\n",
    " \n",
    " ANSWER-In programming languages data type is an important concept.Variable can store data of different types and different types do different things.\n",
    " i) X=\"sanjay\"  -> its a String data type which returns you only string values.It's a collection of unicode characters.\n",
    " ii) X=45  ->its a Interger data type which returns you integer values only.It's a whole numbers in programming.\n",
    " iii)X=80.03 -> is's a Float data type which returns you only float values.It's a numeric data type.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " # 4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    " \n",
    " ANSWER-An expression is a combination of operators and operands that is interpreted to produce some other value in programming.The operator indicate what action or operation to perform and operand are the variable or constants on which operators works.\n",
    " Example-> X+Y ,where X,Y are operand and + is operator.\n",
